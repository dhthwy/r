"Call me toxic:

I'm gonna ignore all their attempts to reach out to me.

I'll never reach out to them.

I'm not gonna actually talk to them.

I'm gonna play tricks, and then file court orders against them.

I'm gonna trash them to the press / reporters.

I'm gonna get jerks to harass them.

I'm gonna fuck up their money in various ways.

I'm not gonna actually give any moment of my time to them.

I'm gonna violate their trust and privacy to the fullest extent.

I don't actually fulfill any promises.

I'm gonna play with them, and watch them get fucked up.

Call me toxic. LOL.

Oh, you're the type that blames other people FOR THE THINGS YOU DO.

"Be kind. Get kind.

Be a jerk. Get jerk.

You chose the #2 option. Claimed all these excuses. Turned out - all lies.

Not the same anymore.. Riiiiight. That doesn't fly when you do the same ol shit.

"Fuck people up as you did, expect to get some in return. It's no different than hitting someone, especially after warnings to stop."

"You're there for those you DO care about. You were always a liar. That's a fact.

No one likes a liar. Especially one who wastes so much. Know what I mean? No. You don't.

Toxic? Who was? You were nothin but an asshole liar to me the.whole.time.

Sadly I guess no one taught you that lyin and wastin isn't very nice. Poor upbringing. No excuse tho, you should've learned this in school.

"No worries. There's nothing for me to do.

However, I reserve the right to fuck you up. Just like you fucked me up you perfidicous cunt.

YOu have done nothing but harm and violated my privacy for many years.

You and your fuckin dick.

I ought to get some other cunt to attack your ass. That would be for balance.

Anyway. Fuck you. Go to hell. Eat a dick. Choke on it. Cunt bitch."
