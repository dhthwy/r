mostly just battered down to a broken dysfunctional mess.

don't know how to fix it.

not rich with unlimited funds to blow.

bidirectional lack of knowledge

bidirectional 'don't know who this is'

gardens full of traps

full of bad memories

terrible screams in my ear

chances to fix but they were snubbed, and not by me

so I don't know
