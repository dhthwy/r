"You wanna send someone to a nightmare. Send them there.

Dr made shit up and tried to coerce me into admitting to it.

Dr said I would remain there indefinitely until I confessed.

I imagine weaker minded would've done so to get that wack job off their ass.

I just kept telling him 'No I didn't.' And he kept saying 'Yes you did!' and we took that for a loop about a dozen times until the jerk quit.

So I spent most of my time passing a ball with some kid.

The nurses commented 'Hey! you're not a bad guy!"

'We just think you're an alcoholic.'

So I said 'na, I rarely drink. Just drank a 5th of henny I'd been saving by accident.'

Nurse: 'well most people who drink that much would be passed out on the floor. But not you. You were an alert chatter mouth with a .350'"

NO ONE should have had the right to screw that up.

That was a freedom play, and it was destroyed.

Freedom from anguish, freedom from harm, freedom to find a happy way.

DESTROYED.

Just what the hell did you think my intentions were? NEVER before did I intentionally do anything to mess you up. I held back JUST TO KEEP from doing so! And I didn't wine like a little bitch about it either. No. I wined like a bitch when you were tearing apart my soul.

I'm no god. I told you my hand. Said I needed a little help. Never over-played it.
