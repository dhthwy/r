"Call me toxic:

I'm gonna ignore all their attempts to reach out to me.

I'll never reach out to them.

I'm not gonna actually talk to them.

I'm gonna play tricks, and then file court orders against them.

I'm gonna trash them to the press / reporters.

I'm gonna get jerks to harass them.

I'm gonna fuck up their money in various ways.

I'm not gonna actually give any moment of my time to them.

I'm gonna violate their trust and privacy to the fullest extent.

I don't actually fulfill any promises.

I'm gonna play with them, and watch them get fucked up.

Call me toxic. LOL.

Oh, you're the type that blames other people FOR THE THINGS YOU DO.

"Be kind. Get kind.

Be a jerk. Get jerk.

You chose the #2 option. Claimed all these excuses. Turned out - all lies.

Not the same anymore.. Riiiiight. That doesn't fly when you do the same ol shit.
