You didn't make room for two. You made room for only one. Screwing me over for other people is something you've always done. No more wasting time and money on people who don't care.

It is very interesting that I've said this about a 100 times so far, esp in the beginning of the year, and yet you didn't give a shit, and screwed me over anyway. :)

I don't have anymore to waste on someone who doesn't care about me anyway.

No love lost. There never was any from you. Super obvious by your own actions this year.

All you left me with is negative 10k and many years of life-sucking.

All the good things I could've done with that money and time. 

But I get it. It's no fun to build. Destroying is far more enjoyable.

Should've known. Screwed me over the first time for someone else. Then did it again.
