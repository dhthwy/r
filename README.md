"Go stuff your face with Lester's cock you arrogant perfidious machiavellian monkey"

"All established understandings and agreements were all flushed down the toilet last year. Made sure I wasted bands to learn it the hard way too.

Not only did you take freedom and bands away from me. You both made sure I knew it with your bragamoo and mockadoodledoo.

Fuck you again. Fuck you everyday. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSK8jTzl1Kw

I don't have anything for wastegirls but my middle finger.

This horse was beaten to death last year.

You replaying the same old BULLSHIT.

You didn't give a god damn of anything concerning me.

In fact you haven't shown any kindness to me since '23."
