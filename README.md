My thinking isn't "gee there isn't anything out there for me. It's too hard."

It is true the industry is messed up, but it's not impossible.

I believe there is something. I just can't do it while I'm like this.

I can't even talk to people anymore. Missing out on 10s of thousands of money saved per year.


So I reacted that way because I believed you were being mean.

Because I said something mean. Sure didn't seem like you had any time for me when it's 'only after everyone else.'

Maybe I would've been nicer about things if you were actually nice to me.
