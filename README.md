"Good luck.

Don't trust you anymore. More about trust than anything else.

Oh, I was going to do it before, but then I saw no. No doubt it was the right choice, now that I know better.

Only way I see it happening is if you spent time and money, and instead of talking to you, I hook up with some other bitch. Make sure you know. Then have the other bitch laugh in your face while you leave empty handed. Do that a few times-ensure you spend a lot-, and shove how I'm fucking someone else in your face for a cpl years all the while telling you how much I care about your feelings inbetween standing you up for the other bitch while they laugh in your face daily. THEN maybe.

Exactly.How.You.Did.Me.Discusting.Bitch

But by then too old.

Anyway, good luck! and I hope you choke to death on that fat braggy cock."
