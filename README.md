"And yes I understand it was I who allowed my own self to get fucked dead.

I set boundaries to avoid it, and it was easy to tell they were being ignored.

And I had a bad feeling telling me 'yep, you're getting fucked dead again.'

But I ignored my gut. Took that leap of faith anyway, and got fucked dead.

Now I don't even think I have the time to get on my own feet.

And sicker than ever.

Such lovely kind people in the world.

Everyone always out to waste other people. It's marvelous. Absolutely.

"I think I'm basically already fucked, where before '20 I used to actually have hope.

So I'm not really nice.

No. You don't know how it feels. Or you wouldn't do it. And if you did and you did it anyway, then you deserve this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vzlzl-19Gc

"I won't be buying any new cars any time soon. Fuck that. Just like everything else, they're degrading survivability for fancy features and fuel effeciency. People don't even know how to use mirrors anymore.

They put computer chips all over the whole vehicle, and there are many instances of people being left walking since they're all interconnected via the CAN bus, so when one fails the whole car electrical system falls apart. Oh and it's not like they're protecting all of these electrical computer boards from corrosion and such. Nah, why do that? They'd prefer you to buy another car in 10 years or 150k miles if it even lasts that long. So figure on $350/mo to keep a damn car + insurance + repairs and maintenance on top of that. And ofc, that 350 is if you save for a 40k car yourself.

https://www.thegeneral.com/going-places/blog/car-and-driving-basics/most-fuel-efficient-vehicles-introduced-each-year-1975/ - did you know that there were many vehicles built in the 70s and 80s with 30+ mpg?

Simple is better.

Min wage job. I don't know whether he came into some money to help him get started or if he did it all on his own but apparently by way of his acts of kindness, he's actually doing quite well for himself too. Actually, they do it as a couple."

I was letting it go. Just don't appreciate bullshit and repeat of the same.

Let it go.

Fine.

I doubt there's anything now though. My gut told me that early last year and it was right.

They're all yours. I mean 100%. Not even enough left for a chat. That's the way it's been and the way it is now.

That's the way I see you now, which I think was the point you were making. Maybe I would've taken it better if you actually ever kind to me.
