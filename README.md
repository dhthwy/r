I know you are a liar. You've been playing me from the start, and now you have your penis in on it with you.

You're going to fuck with me like that after all the harm you caused? YOu fucking evil diabolical jerks. That motherfucker deserves it. By all means, push me.

I don't have anymore to waste on someone who doesn't care about me anyway.

No love lost. There never was any from you. Super obvious by your own actions this year.

All you left me with is negative 10k and many years of life-sucking.

All the good things I could've done with that money and time. 

But I get it. It's no fun to build. Destroying is far more enjoyable.

Should've known. Screwed me over the first time for someone else. Then did it again.
