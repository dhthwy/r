"I guess it's always nice to have people who happily carry on your traditions. Even if it's one of poo.

But in doing so - you lost benefit of doubt and your word became trash.

"It's no secret they've been pooping on me for nearly 6 years. Hell, they started off that way.

Then it's 'Sorry, it came out by accident."

Oh but then again and again 'Sorry, I can't control my ass.'

Before long, 'if anyone needs to go poopy, this is the one you flex your anus on'

I live in a nest of sandbags. What does it take for one to feel they have to live that way?

Peace? Freedom? None of that.

Everyone knew. No one cared.

Only thing I had to change that. But no one cared.

All this 'inclusion' bidness but it was really exclusion for the pooped on.

See what I mean? Problem is, there was no getting any point across.

Even if they appeared to get the point - it evaporates out they head by the next day.

Speaker? Is still being pooped on.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt for most of that stretch. Sure sometimes I forgot to, but 99% of the time I retained it.

It's a damn shame. It's a damn waste. Not what I wanted. But can't really do anything about it when you're excluded, and people are acting like your enemy.
