"Well as I said:

A pie has been split into 10000 little slices.

The rules are:

You get to spend lots for a 1 in 100 chance for a super tiny slice.

Everyone else gets 100% chance all-you-can shots.

Done. Fuckin jerk.

It could've been different, but you had no problems at all throwing years away with zero while you rack it up on the other hand. That's just messed up.

Actually, as a pragmatist (you have to be to write decent code), I think I would've done well if I had just kept doing what I Was doing 5 years ago rather than getting caught up in a spider web, and subsquently murdered. Only stretch in my life where I've been completely incapacitated, which will very likely lead to early death. Super nice people.

It's dumb as hell to mess with people who don't value you. It just brings you down and wastes pretty much everything. Worse than being alone. :)

It's like less than 1% at best lol.

1/1000.

Basically pointless.

I don't know.

Far as I'm concerned nothing actually real was for me.

Can't continue to repetively be messed up.

I complained about time back then. Instead of listening, You just gave me 0 of it as you had something better to do.

Why bother when you gave away 100s of hours of time, and still haven't given me shit, and even if i got any, it wouldn't be nothing in comparison.

Bad road. Dead end.

Yes, there are far worse things than being alone. Let’s take a look:
>> Being with someone who makes you feel more alone than actually being alone.

>> Being with someone who doesn’t align with your values.

>> Being with someone who is unfaithful.

>> Being with someone who doesn’t respect you.

>> Being with someone who treats you as an option.

>> Being with someone you cannot trust.

>> Being with someone who makes you feel worthless.

>> Being with someone who repeatedly lets you down.

>> Being with someone who deliberately crosses your boundaries.

>> Being with someone who doesn’t hear or see you.

>> Being with someone who makes you feel small.

>> Being with someone who makes you feel like you are too much.

>> Being with someone who refuses to commit to you.

>> Being with someone who controls you.

>> Being with someone who abuses you. Physically, sexually, emotionally.

>> Being a person you no longer recognise.

>> Disrespecting yourself to keep the calm.

>> People pleasing to keep the peace.

>> Avoiding confrontation because you’re scared to lose your partner.

>> Distracting yourself with someone to convince yourself you’re not alone.

hmm. looks most of them boxes are checked.

GEE I wonder why I'm so much more screwed up than I used to be."

When a girl likes someone they make it easy for them, and show them all the sites and talk to them all the time.

For everyone else - it's harassment - as demonstrated.

Thanks again for ruining the only thing I had that possibly could've been the fix.

Didn't need to be shown 'life is hell'

I've already been chewed up and spit out countless times.
