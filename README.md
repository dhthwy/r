Min wage job. I don't know whether he came into some money to help him get started or if he did it all on his own but apparently by way of his acts of kindness, he's actually doing quite well for himself too. Actually, they do it as a couple."

Let it go.

Fine.

I doubt there's anything now though. My gut told me that early last year and it was right.

They're all yours. I mean 100%. Not even enough left for a chat. That's the way it's been and the way it is now.

That's the way I see you now, which I think was the point you were making. Maybe I would've taken it better if you actually ever kind to me.
