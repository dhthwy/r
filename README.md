I dub you a new nickname: Lipass

How you figure you can fool after you had someone tell them how it really is, and then you back it up with actions. Can't go back after that. You can huddle and scheme new ways to fool, but you already let the cat outta the bag.

I know you are a liar. You've been playing me from the start, and now you have your penis in on it with you. They already admitted the fact that you're playing me for a fool long ago.

You're going to fuck with me like that after all the harm you caused? YOu fucking evil diabolical jerks.

I don't have anymore to waste on someone who doesn't care about me anyway.

No love lost. There never was any from you. Super obvious by your own actions this year.

All you left me with is negative 10k and many years of life-sucking.

All the good things I could've done with that money and time. 

But I get it. It's no fun to build. Destroying is far more enjoyable.

Should've known. Screwed me over the first time for someone else. Then did it again.
