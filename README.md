What did you expect with such food?

"Sure would be nice to get clean. But damn did I try. And damn was I fucked for tryin."

"
This actually happened to a lady who is a close family friend. At one point, she worked at a convalescent home—not just for old people, but for folks who were a little nuts and couldn't take care of themselves.

One lady there had a specific disorder where she thought everything was food. She would eat her dinner and then immediately start trying to eat the napkins. As you can guess, she ended up morbidly obese. She was eventually too large for the showers, so they had to take her out back and hose her down like an elephant. Because of her size, she had many skin rolls that were nearly impossible to keep clean.

One day, the family friend was making her rounds of the complex when she was stopped by a man in a wheelchair. He mumbled something at her: "Bitch stole my Doritos..." When she asked him to repeat himself, he got agitated. "That fat lady stole my Doritos and she won't give 'em back!" Trying to keep the peace, the friend replied, "Okay, okay, calm down. I'll get your chips back for you."

She went into the lady's room and found her alone with the chips—and nothing else. She was buck naked, and due to a severe infection, there was a thick, almost gelatinous discharge. The lady was dipping the chips into herself and eating them, with the discharge stretching like melted cheese on a pizza. She apparently had a big smile on her face as it dripped down her chin.

I haven’t had a Dorito since.

"Like I said. You're the horse, and I am mr hands whose bowels were perforated by your huge member.

I think of all the times you perforated me. It's so numerous I had to write it down to remember them all.

Fucked. Perforated. No kiss tho."

https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle-medicine-2-relationships/ - "Yep, you sure cared about that over the years. lol. Oh, for yourself, sure. Your exclusion tactics were well played.

In essense, as you are already well familar with the topic, that article suggests you tried to murder me intentionally. Fuck my life to death eh? Such wonderful, kind person you are."

Told ya.

I'm not nice.

I don't see anything nice.

The world isn't nice.

Not for a very long time.

No one is nice.

"I think I'm basically already fucked, where before '20 I used to actually have hope.

So I'm not really nice.

No. You don't know how it feels. Or you wouldn't do it. And if you did and you did it anyway, then you deserve this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vzlzl-19Gc

"I won't be buying any new cars any time soon. Fuck that. Just like everything else, they're degrading survivability for fancy features and fuel effeciency. People don't even know how to use mirrors anymore.

They put computer chips all over the whole vehicle, and there are many instances of people being left walking since they're all interconnected via the CAN bus, so when one fails the whole car electrical system falls apart. Oh and it's not like they're protecting all of these electrical computer boards from corrosion and such. Nah, why do that? They'd prefer you to buy another car in 10 years or 150k miles if it even lasts that long. So figure on $350/mo to keep a damn car + insurance + repairs and maintenance on top of that. And ofc, that 350 is if you save for a 40k car yourself.

https://www.thegeneral.com/going-places/blog/car-and-driving-basics/most-fuel-efficient-vehicles-introduced-each-year-1975/ - did you know that there were many vehicles built in the 70s and 80s with 30+ mpg?

Simple is better.

Min wage job. I don't know whether he came into some money to help him get started or if he did it all on his own but apparently by way of his acts of kindness, he's actually doing quite well for himself too. Actually, they do it as a couple."

I was letting it go. Just don't appreciate bullshit and repeat of the same.

Let it go.

Fine.

I doubt there's anything now though. My gut told me that early last year and it was right.

They're all yours. I mean 100%. Not even enough left for a chat. That's the way it's been and the way it is now.

That's the way I see you now, which I think was the point you were making. Maybe I would've taken it better if you actually ever kind to me.
