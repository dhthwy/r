"I didn't gain anything. I was simply beaten when I was down. Robbed of all human contact. Every time I try. That's how it always goes. Thanks again for giving me more of the same lifetime experiences."

Let's not talk about time where you have given me zero and excluded me multiple times.

It's ok for me to be excluded, but not them. I understand.

And I would've had relatively very little time.

For you to think it's ok to dilute the very little time for me when you spend loads and loads with everyone else is messed up.

That's how I know you don't care.

You want to give me almost nothing, but give everyone else a lot, and then share the little bit I might have.

That's not appealing to me. Maybe it would've been fine before I was excluded all those times, but not anymore.

"Not caring much for me is fine. That I could deal with. 

It's the indifference.

Money wouldn't have been an issue. But for most people, throwing away 'lots' of money for nothing is harmful.

I needed out. Isolation makes you DUMB. Hearing loss and isolation known to cause cognitive decline.

All I asked for was help de-isolating. Make someone feel like they aren't alone."
