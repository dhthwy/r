Well I've only been living with intense pain for long as I can remember now. I honestly don't remember what anything else feels like. Even excercise doesn't help.

Evidently when you've been like this for this long, you simply stop looking forward to anything positive, which is pretty much saying 'lost will to live.'

Kinda hard to fix that when your facial expression makes people run. But I've been saying this stuff for a long long time. It's only gotten much worse.

Too bad, I have absolutely no one to talk to or even hug. Vomit vomit vomit.
