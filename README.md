'Same ol' rhetoric. Same ol' plays. Same ol' people. Same ol' waste games.

I remember when I was too fucked up to drive after you wasted me. You just left me stranded. Then you turned your back and walked away. Some sweet memories.

You speak of clarity. You certainly made your intent to waste clear.'

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7OgIMMRc4 - "You ruined it."

"Think I'd roll up to you when you refused to speak with me, after all the horrible things you did.

We had to first talk to actually talk.

No safety. No framework for coordinating. No way to know if you were even there. No way to know if I was welcome.

Got people repeating the same ol' shit in my ear from long ago. That's how I know it's all coming from one source - YOU. Your blame game fell apart.

You admitted yourself at the beginning of last year that you didn't have my back. No different than you saying 'no loyalty. don't care about you.'

Think I'd roll up. That's the perfect place for you to fuck me over big. I have no reasonable excuse to be there.

I'm not the irrational choice type.

That you keep me on this speaker only shows your intent to double down on this long stretch of disrespect.

"As a young NBA player fresh out of the 2003 draft, one night out, Wade found himself standing next to one of his idols — Allen Iverson — not in an arena, but at a casino table. For most rookies, that moment would’ve ended with empty pockets and a story they’d regret. Instead, it revealed something far more important about Wade: his levelheadedness, self-awareness and a refusal to make irrational choices."

“So I go with Eddie Jones, and he knew Allen Iverson was one of my favorite players, so he wanted to introduce me. And he introduced me to Iverson right there when they were gambling, so Iverson’s gambling and I’m standing there the whole time. And he threw me a $1,000 chip and was like, ‘Yo, go play this, young fella.’ So I played $500, and I put the other $500 in my pocket, because I didn’t have money like that at the time,” Wade recalled."

"It would have been just as easy for Wade to put the full $1,000 all on black and never think about it again. After all, his rookie deal was lucrative as a lottery pick — but that wasn't his mentality even with generational wealth just around the corner.

While many young players get swept up in the lifestyle, Wade instinctively understood restraint. Pocketing half the chip wasn’t fear — it was awareness. It was evidently also a stark difference from Iverson's mentality when it came to money."

"I lost count of the # of times you snitched on me for the purpose of humiliation and harm over the course of 6 YEARS.

At least several times? Your crackheads not only approved; THEY PATRONIZED AND MOCKED WITH YOU! It was YOU. It was YOU all along.

This isn't about winning.

Imagine someone robbed you of 10k and many many years, perhaps decades. How would you feel? What would you do?

"There shoulda been no tug-o-war shit.

On one end we had: 'i'm jus tryna bust another nut na mean?'

On the other: 'freedom please. beg beg beg. free us from this!'

That shouldn't have even been up for discussion.

We know what you chose. It's discusting.

Told me all I needed to know about you.

Also why I reference your edumucation. You should be able to think for yourself on these matters. Especially on social matters. That's what edumucation is for. ONLY YOU had the complete picture. You can try to 'tell' it but they will never have the same picture- there is a lot more than some words, AND they're pre-decided prejudicially biased anyway. So the only fair and right choice can come from you.

If they respect you, they would have accepted any boundaries you set.

But you made your choice and chose no to freedom. So either that was your right decision, or you let someone else destroy it. Either way, the result is the same.

And if you have told me your choice respectfully instead of playing wastegirl to put a smile on their face, I would've been respectful about it. But you've never shown any of that for me before, so I'm not surprised."

"Go stuff your face with Lester's cock you arrogant perfidious machiavellian monkey"

"All established understandings and agreements were all flushed down the toilet last year. Made sure I wasted bands to learn it the hard way too.

Not only did you take freedom and bands away from me. You both made sure I knew it with your bragamoo and mockadoodledoo.

Fuck you again. Fuck you everyday. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSK8jTzl1Kw

I don't have anything for wastegirls but my middle finger.

This horse was beaten to death last year.

You replaying the same old BULLSHIT.

You didn't give a god damn of anything concerning me.

In fact you haven't shown any kindness to me since '23."
