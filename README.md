Recall that I remember everything.

"I'm most important."

"I take priority."

"Forget him. He can wait."

Right in the midst of me on my knees, and begging for a little convo. I mean, what else could I expect? That was all I needed to set things right.

You were just fine with leaving me to rot.

Obviously, or you wouldn't have ran off without so much as a word.

But you wouldn't treat them that way.

Now I have major changes coming up. One of the reasons I pleaded so much. Without your input, my decisions are based on me alone.

Might be too late now.

Your choice. I did what I could.

There was no way to know what I could do and what I couldn't do. Only had history to go by.

It was up to you to show me. But you also screwed me over at the same time. All that waiting for nada.

Let's not talk about time where you have given me zero and excluded me multiple times.

It's ok for me to be excluded, but not them. I understand.

And I would've had relatively very little time.

For you to think it's ok to dilute the very little time for me when you spend loads and loads with everyone else is messed up.

That's how I know you don't care.

You want to give me almost nothing, but give everyone else a lot, and then share the little bit I might have.

That's not appealing to me. Maybe it would've been fine before I was excluded all those times, but not anymore.

"Not caring much for me is fine. That I could deal with. 

It's the indifference.

Money wouldn't have been an issue. But for most people, throwing away 'lots' of money for nothing is harmful.

I needed out. Isolation makes you DUMB. Hearing loss and isolation known to cause cognitive decline.

All I asked for was help de-isolating. Make someone feel like they aren't alone."
