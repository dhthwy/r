At this point, it would take lots of time and room for only one to move me. We both know that'll never happen. So it's out. Years vs zero, and you still didn't care to make time for me. A little bit doesn't incentivize or motivate me in any way after you showed me just how much time you do give to those you do care about.

Frankly, I really don't care anymore. Thinking of you only brings me pain, and discusts me. Too much time wasted, and no real chances to heal, and more time wasted continues to move me further away to the extent that I believe it's too late now.

Better off alone.

You didn't make room for two. You made room for only one. Screwing me over for other people is something you've always done. No more wasting time and money on people who don't care.

It is very interesting that I've said this about a 100 times so far, esp in the beginning of the year, and yet your _actions_ didn't give a shit, and screwed me over anyway. :)

Don't give a god damn what you say or what I think you say. It all turns to poopy when it gets real and your actions show me the opposite.

Didn't matter that I was on my knees calling your name and begging. You had no troubles screwing me over in the midst of it. No kind words. Nothing. Absolutely nothing good. Well you got what your actions asked for!

I don't have anymore to waste on someone who doesn't care about me anyway.

No love lost. There never was any from you. Super obvious by your own actions this year.

All you left me with is negative 10k and many years of life-sucking.

All the good things I could've done with that money and time. 

But I get it. It's no fun to build. Destroying is far more enjoyable.

Should've known. Screwed me over the first time for someone else. Then did it again.
