All was forgiven. BUT a big but, when forgiveness was based on a lie, it gets recanted.

You simply proved you don't care at all for me, which means you never did, because no one does that shit to anyone they've ever cared for.

Doesn't matter now. It's been all for them.

Your actions have spoken, and the resulting damage was done. Forever.

One of these days I'll upload a vid of a milf on my knob. Ok?

Tricking me into losing that much resources, which could've went toward things that I need or actually helped, is an act of enemy. I reserve rights to be ruthless."

Yes, there are far worse things than being alone. Let’s take a look:
>> Being with someone who makes you feel more alone than actually being alone.

>> Being with someone who doesn’t align with your values.

>> Being with someone who is unfaithful.

>> Being with someone who doesn’t respect you.

>> Being with someone who treats you as an option.

>> Being with someone you cannot trust.

>> Being with someone who makes you feel worthless.

>> Being with someone who repeatedly lets you down.

>> Being with someone who deliberately crosses your boundaries.

>> Being with someone who doesn’t hear or see you.

>> Being with someone who makes you feel small.

>> Being with someone who makes you feel like you are too much.

>> Being with someone who refuses to commit to you.

>> Being with someone who controls you.

>> Being with someone who abuses you. Physically, sexually, emotionally.

>> Being a person you no longer recognise.

>> Disrespecting yourself to keep the calm.

>> People pleasing to keep the peace.

>> Avoiding confrontation because you’re scared to lose your partner.

>> Distracting yourself with someone to convince yourself you’re not alone.

hmm. looks most of them boxes are checked.

GEE I wonder why I'm so much more screwed up than I used to be."

When a girl likes someone they make it easy for them, and show them all the sites and talk to them all the time.

For everyone else - it's harassment - as demonstrated.

Thanks again for ruining the only thing I had that possibly could've been the fix.

Didn't need to be shown 'life is hell'

I've already been chewed up and spit out countless times.
