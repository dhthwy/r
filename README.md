"Stay curled up under the blankets. Helps tolerate. Someone might sing happy bday to my door again. I took something for the pain awhile back, and i felt free. But couldn't keep taking that and dr's don't prescribe. And we wonder why people resort to hardcore drugs.

'Doc, I wanna live again! Help free me from this crippling pain that keeps me curled up in a ball under covers.

dr: junkie! U aint in no pain. There nothing wrong with you.

Look at the world today. Life is all about war and enemies.

Pay a hoe to be one for a bit? I don't know. They'd be my enemy too if I weren't a client. I lose either way.

Nothin but predators out there. Try bein nice. Yeah. You know how that goes. Selfish. Take take take. Smile. Stomp. Smile. Stomp.

Aint no healin.

Well I've only been living with intense pain for long as I can remember now. I honestly don't remember what anything else feels like. Even excercise doesn't help.

Evidently when you've been like this for this long, you simply stop looking forward to anything positive, which is pretty much saying 'lost will to live.'

Kinda hard to fix that when your facial expression makes people run. But I've been saying this stuff for a long long time. It's only gotten much worse.

Too bad, I have absolutely no one to talk to or even hug. Vomit vomit vomit.
